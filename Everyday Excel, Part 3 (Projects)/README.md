# Everyday Excel, Part 3 (Projects)

"Everyday Excel, Part 3 (Projects)" is a continuation of "Everyday Excel, Parts 1 and 2".  It is a capstone, projects-based course in which you will apply what you've learned previously to more complex, somewhat open-ended projects (open-ended with respect to the fact that they can be solved in multiple ways).

Each learner must complete 3"warm-up" projects (chosen from 3), 3 intermediate projects (chosen from 6), and 3 main (more difficult) projects (chosen from 5).  The projects have been created to span a wide range of interests and topic areas and are anticipated to appeal to diverse learner backgrounds.

It is hoped that this project-based courses will dramatically reinforce the application of Excel tools, techniques, and functions to real-world projects.
